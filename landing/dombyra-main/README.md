3. Connect your GitHub repository or upload your code
4. Configure the service:
   - Name: Choose a name for your service

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```

2. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start

3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Data Management

The application works with JSON files for data storage:

- [repertoire.json](file:///c%3A/Users/%D0%90%D0%B4%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD/Desktop/dombyra/repertoire.json) - Main repertoire data file
- [cleaned_repertoire.json](file:///c%3A/Users/%D0%90%D0%B4%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD/Desktop/dombyra/cleaned_repertoire.json) - Cleaned version of repertoire data

To update the repertoire data, simply edit the [repertoire.json](file:///c%3A/Users/%D0%90%D0%B4%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD/Desktop/dombyra/repertoire.json) file.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/search?piece=<title>&count=<number>` - Search for people who know a piece
- `GET /api/repertoire` - Get all repertoire data
- `GET /api/pieces` - Get all pieces

## Data Import

### Excel Import

To import data from an Excel file:

1. Prepare your Excel file with columns "Name" and "PieceTitle"
2. Save the file (e.g., as data.xlsx)
3. Run the import script:
   ```
   node import.js <path-to-excel-file>
   ```
   
   Or use the npm script:
   ```
   npm run import <path-to-excel-file>
   ```

### Managing Repertoire Data

You can also use the Python script to manage repertoire data:

1. Edit cleaned_repertoire.json directly or use manage_repertoire.py
2. Run the Python script to clean and validate data:
   ```
   python manage_repertoire.py
   ```
3. Test the JSON structure:
   ```
   npm run test-json
   ```
4. Copy the cleaned data to repertoire.json:
   ```
   cp cleaned_repertoire.json repertoire.json
   ```

## Deployment

To deploy on Render:
1. Create a new web service
2. Connect your repository
3. Set the build command to `npm install`
4. Set the start command to `npm start`
